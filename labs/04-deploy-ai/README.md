# 04 - Deploy AI

In this folder you will find exercises to help increase your understanding of how to deploy AI Apps to Azure.

Below is a list of each of the labs in this section and what each one sets out to achieve.

## 01-ACS + Sematic Kernel C#

[ACS + Semantic Kernel C#](01-acs-sk-csharp-api/README.md)

In this lab, we'll turn the 03-orchestration/04-ACS/acs-sk-csharp.ipynb notebook lab into an ASP.NET Core API that can then be consumed by a front-end application.

## 02-ChainLitAgent

[Chat UI using Chainlit](02-chainlitagent-ui/README.md)

In this lab, we'll walk through deploying a simple UI that will consume the ASP.NET Core API in the first lab above. The UI will be built using a ChainLit App built in Python which is a simple and easy way to quickly mockup a UI for a ChatGPT like experience.
